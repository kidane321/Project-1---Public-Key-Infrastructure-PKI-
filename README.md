The learning objective of this lab is for students to gain the first-hand experience on PKI. SEED labs have a series of labs focusing on the public-key cryptography, and this one focuses on PKI. By doing the tasks in this lab, students should be able to gain a better understanding of how PKI works, how PKI is used to protect the Web, and how Man-in-the-middle attacks can be defeated by PKI. Moreover, students will be able to understand the root of the trust in the public-key infrastructure, and what problems will arise if the root trust is broken. This lab covers the following topics: • Public-key encryption • Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) • Certificate Authority (CA) and root CA • X.509 certificate and self-signed certificate • Apache, HTTP, and HTTPS • Man-in-the-middle attacks
